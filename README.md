# Full_Adder_RTL

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a **Full Adder** constructed using ***two Half Adders***. 
<br/> A Full Adder is a combinational circuit that performs binary addition on three input bits, producing a sum and a carry-out.
<br/> In the Verilog code, module named **half_adder** represents a half adder, which adds two binary inputs and produces a sum and a carry-out.
<br/> The Verilog module named **full_adder** constructs a Full Adder by instantiating two HalfAdder modules and connecting them appropriately.
<br/> *Design Language: **Verilog***
<br/> *Design Tool: **Xilinx Vivado***
